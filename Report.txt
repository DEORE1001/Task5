1. Overview
File analyzed: task5.pcapa

Capture duration: 07:01:48,040,068 to 07:01:49,555,721 (~1.5 seconds)

Total packets: 20 distinct entries

Key protocols: TCP, UDP, TLS, DNS, ARP, ICMPv6, HTTP(S)

2. Key Observations
A. Protocol Distribution
TCP: Majority of traffic (HTTPS, TLS-encrypted data)

UDP: DNS queries/responses and ICMPv6

ARP: 2 requests for local IP resolution (192.168.1.11, 192.168.1.237)

TLS/SSL: Encrypted application data (e.g., port 443)

DNS: Queries for www.youtube.com

ICMPv6: IPv6 neighbor discovery packets

B. IP Addresses
Local Device: 192.168.1.5 (initiates most traffic)

External Servers:

34.237.73.95 (Amazon AWS)

96.171.22.12 (likely a CDN/server)

8.8.8.8 (Google DNS)

142.250.70.78 (YouTube server)

IPv6 Addresses: 2001:db8:: prefixes (test addresses) in ICMPv6 packets

C. Port Activity
HTTPS/TLS:

Port 443 (e.g., YouTube, Amazon)

Port 01BB (hex) = 443

DNS: Port 53 (UDP)

Ephemeral Ports: High-numbered ports (51383, 54163) for outbound connections

3. Traffic Highlights
A. DNS Activity
Query: www.youtube.com sent to 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS) at 07:01:49,345,161.

Response: Multiple A records returned for YouTube (e.g., 142.250.70.78).

B. HTTPS/TLS Traffic
YouTube Access:

TLS handshake with 142.250.70.78 (port 443) post-DNS resolution.

Large encrypted data transfers (packets ~1.5 KBâ€“4 KB).

Amazon Server:

Early TLS session with 34.237.73.95 (port 443).

C. ARP Requests
2 broadcast requests:

For 192.168.1.11 (at 07:01:48,582,930).

For 192.168.1.237 (at 07:01:48,779,864).

No responses captured, suggesting these hosts were offline or unreachable.

D. ICMPv6 Packets
Neighbor discovery messages for IPv6 address resolution (e.g., fe80::f4c8:59f0:d4:627c).

4. Security Notes
Encryption: All HTTP traffic uses TLS (no plaintext exposed).

No Threats Detected: No malware signatures or suspicious ports (e.g., 6667/IRC).

ARP Spoofing?: Unanswered ARP requests may indicate network scans but are inconclusive alone.

5. Summary
Primary Activity: Web browsing (YouTube, Amazon services).

Network Behavior:

Heavy use of encrypted HTTPS.

Reliance on Google DNS (8.8.8.8).

Local network scans via ARP.

Recommendations:

Monitor unanswered ARP requests for potential network issues.

Verify TLS certificates for youtube.com/amazon.com to rule out MITM attacks.
