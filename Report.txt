# üìÑ Network Packet Analysis Report
**File Analyzed:** taskk5.txt  
**Analyst:** Rohit  
**Date:** July 1, 2025  
**Tool Used:** Wireshark (exported packet hex view)

---

## üßæ Summary
The packet data from `taskk5.txt` represents real-time communication involving a local machine (`192.168.1.5`) and external IPs. The traffic includes encrypted TLS handshakes, HTTP-related TCP traffic, DNS queries, and multiple ARP lookups. There is also clear evidence of multicast service discovery protocols such as mDNS and SSDP.

## üìä Protocols Identified

| Protocol | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **TCP**  | Used for HTTP, HTTPS (Port 80, 443). Observed SYN/ACK handshakes and ACK flags. |
| **TLS**  | Encrypted communication, visible as raw data starting with `17 03 03`, indicating TLS 1.2 or 1.3 packets. |
| **UDP**  | Present in DNS, mDNS, and SSDP traffic. |
| **SSDP** | Service discovery over `239.255.255.250:1900`, typically UPnP devices. |
| **mDNS** | Local hostname resolution (`224.0.0.251:5353`), part of Apple/Bonjour or IoT traffic. |
| **ARP**  | Resolving local IPs to MAC addresses. Broadcast MACs (`ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff`) indicate ARP requests. |

## üìç Traffic Details

### üîê TLS Encrypted Traffic
- **Time:** `07:01:48.040`
- **Destination Port:** 443 (HTTPS)
- **Signature:** Packets starting with `17 03 03` ‚Äî TLS application data
- **Interpretation:** Client is engaged in encrypted browsing session, likely to a site like Google or Firefox captive portal.

### üåç SSDP (UDP Port 1900)
- **Time:** `07:01:48.284`
- **Multicast IP:** `239.255.255.250`
- **Usage:** Device/service discovery (e.g., printers, smart TVs)

### üì° mDNS (UDP Port 5353)
- **Time:** `07:01:48.736`
- **Multicast IP:** `224.0.0.251`
- **Usage:** Resolving local device names on LAN without a DNS server

### üîÅ ARP Requests
- **MAC:** `ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff` (Broadcast)
- **Usage:** Device attempting to discover hardware address of another host
- **Time:** Around `07:01:48.582`

## üìå Notable Packet Patterns

- Encrypted TLS application data was present in majority of traffic after TCP handshakes.
- Ports 443 and 80 were used (HTTPS and HTTP).
- SSDP traffic used `M-SEARCH` requests ‚Äî common in Windows/IoT environments.
- No ICMP (ping) or malicious signatures were found.
- The system also attempted mDNS name resolution using multicast.

---

## üß† Observations

- This capture clearly reflects **early network initialization** traffic:
  - ARP for discovering gateway MAC
  - SSDP/mDNS scanning
  - TLS negotiation with public IPs
- No signs of suspicious or malformed packets.
- Packet lengths vary between 54‚Äì1514 bytes ‚Äî consistent with MTU and segmentation of TLS streams.

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This was a clean capture of real-world encrypted and local discovery traffic.

- TLS confirms active secure web traffic
- SSDP/mDNS indicate LAN-level service awareness
- ARP verifies local IP-to-MAC resolution
- The system shows healthy, baseline startup behavior
