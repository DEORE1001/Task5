Summary:
The capture contains 218 packets recorded over a short session. Traffic was generated by normal system and browser activity. Key protocols detected include TCP, DNS, HTTP, TLS, ARP, and MDNS.

---

Protocol Summary:

TCP - 102 packets
Used for reliable communication (HTTP/TLS). Includes proper 3-way handshakes and terminations.

DNS - 36 packets
Resolved domains like www.google.com and connectivitycheck.gstatic.com. All standard responses.

HTTP - 14 packets
Captured a GET request to detectportal.firefox.com, returning a 200 OK response.

TLS - 28 packets
Encrypted communication with Google servers. Client Hello and Server Hello were observed.

ARP - 24 packets
Resolved MAC addresses in the local subnet.

MDNS & SSDP - 14 packets
Used for service discovery from local devices (e.g., Chromecast, printers).

UDP - 12 packets
Transport protocol for DNS and SSDP.

Sample Packets:

1. DNS Query - www.google.com → IP: 142.250.195.4
2. HTTP Request - detectportal.firefox.com → GET / HTTP/1.1
3. TLS Handshake - Client Hello to 142.250.195.4 on port 443

---

Conclusion:
This was a clean capture with no signs of anomalies or malicious traffic. It demonstrates a typical boot-time or network-initialization sequence for a local machine. The protocols reflect both local discovery and internet access patterns.
